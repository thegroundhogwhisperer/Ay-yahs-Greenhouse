# Raspberry Pi Greenhouse Automation and Remote Environmental System Monitoring Project

This is a for-fun project created for the purpose of automating and remotely monitoring climate control and irrigation in a small greenhouse. System automation is achieved using an ARM based CPU (Raspberry Pi 3) in combination with a Pimoroni Automation HAT. Remote monitoring of environmental conditions is achieved through a layered communication structure. This layered communication is performed using a combination of technologies such as text-to-speech software, Python scripts, and radio frequency transmissions. The primary greenhouse automation script and support files are contained in the Greenhouse subfolder. The remote environmental system montioring Python scripts and support files are contained in the following subfolders:  Greenhousealarm, Greenhousemanualgui, Greenhousereceivedata, Greenhousestatusttsrttysstvpots, Greenhousestatusttsrttysstvrf

# Raspberry Pi Greenhouse Automation Project

Climate control and irrigation control is achieved by monitoring environmental sensor measurements. The environmental sensors measurements are then used to control a linear actuator, solenoid valve, small fan, and small heating pad. The information produced is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen, broadcast via wall messages to the console, written to an html file, csv file, and SQLite database file.

# What it does

# Installation

# Prerequisites

Adafruit_Python_DHT

Use pip to install from PyPI.

Python 2:

sudo pip install Adafruit_DHT

Python 3:

sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT

This script requires pigpiod.

Install pigpio from the Raspbian package manager:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install pigpio

pigpiod -v

Enable remote gpio access using the raspi-conf tool:

Execute raspi-config

Select menu item 5 Inferfacting Options.

Enable P8 Remote GPIO.

Choose Back

Choose Finish

Place all related file in /home/pi/Greenhouse/

Configure execute permissions on greenhouse.py, powerout.py, and camera.py.

sudo chmod +x greenhouse.py 

sudo chmod +x powerout.py 

sudo chmod +x camera.py 

The greenhouse.py script performs environmental monitoring and the conditional evaluation process. Configure cron to execute greenhouse.py, the primary automation script, every two minutes.

The powerout.py script writes file stored values, relays, and outputs to their default due to power outage. Configure cron to execute powerout.py, the power outage reset defaults script, at boot.

The camera.py script writes one high and one low resolution PNG image to /var/www/html. These images are referenced in the static HTML page generated by greenhouse.py

# Example crontab configuration

sudo crontab -e

\# reset default values, relays, and output states after a power outage

@reboot python /home/pi/Greenhouse/powerout.py

\# capture an image every five minutes

*/5 * * * * python /home/pi/Greenhouse/camera.py


crontab -e

\# execute the primary greenhouse automation script every two minutes

*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/pi/Greenhouse/greenhouse.py

Due to the failure rate of the DHT22 sensor a power connector from a floppy disk drive is used for quick sensor replacement.
